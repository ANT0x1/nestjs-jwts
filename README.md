# NestJs Jwt Authentication example with access token and refresh token with integration and end-to-end tests

This is an repository example of how to implement an authentication system in NestJs using passport.js, and json web tokens (JWT).

I've included integration tests in the auth module under "test" folder.

The e2e tests on the other hand are in the root test folder.

```bash
yarn test # run integration test
yarn test:e2e # run e2e tests
```
